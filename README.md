- Hello! I'm a mathematics graduate from The University of Aberdeen interested in learning programming through the application of numerical methods and data analysis.
  
- To do this I've recently began reading Armstrong's _C++ for Financial Mathematics_.
  You can look through - - to find all my solutions I've currently solved to the exercises found in the book.
  Since Armstrong has a page containing full code to all solutions in the book, I feel the need to clarify that the code presented in my repository is all my own work,
  and no consultations have been made throughout my learning process.
- Beyond C++ I've also dabbled in R. The bulk of my  work in this language was confined to a university project which consisted of predicting the effects of climate
  change on the River Tweed. My colleagues focused on predicting the change in the river Tweed's flow taking into account climate change. I used the predicted flow data
  to analyse how the surrounding area in a specific section of the river would be affected. For this I used the libraries OCNet and rivnet together with Taudem to extract
  a model of the river tweed from elevation data in Scotland. All my code for this project can be found in - -.
- Finally, I attempted to build a time series classsifier in Python using scraped data I gathered off a very famous financial analytics website that will remain unnamed.
  I consider this project to be a failure. However, I consider the experience gained in manipulating large datasets utilising pandas, as well as working with JSON files
  and plotting figures using numpy to be of great value. The massive, disorganised code for this project can be found in - -.
